#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software systems. It applies engineering principles to software development to ensure that software is reliable, scalable, efficient, and maintainable. It's important in the tech industry because it helps produce high-quality, bug-free software, and enhances scalability and productivity. Businesses use software engineering to automate processes, optimize operations, and leverage technologies like AI, cloud computing, and IoT

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
One milestone is the development of high-level programming languages like Fortran (1957) and C (1972), which revolutionized software development by making coding more readable, efficient, and accessible. Another is the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s. Software development was now seen as an engineering discipline, emphasizing design, testing, and maintenance. This encouraged methodologies like structured programming, which improved code organization and reliability. Another milestone was the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced, shifting software development from rigid, linear models to iterative, customer-driven approaches. This enabled faster software releases and better responsiveness to changing requirements.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for developing high-quality software. It consists of the following phases:
Planning: Defines project goals, scope, and feasibility, including resource allocation, risk assessment, and budget estimation.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating the software architecture, UI/UX, data structures, and system components based on the requirements.
Implementation(Coding): Developers write and integrate the actual code using programming languages, following best practices.
Testing:  Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software for end-users
Maintenance: Continuously updating and improving the software by fixing bugs, adding features, and optimizing performance.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a sequential, structured process where each phase—planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment—is completed before moving to the next. This approach works best for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as medical software systems or banking applications, where strict documentation and regulatory compliance are essential. On the other hand, Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that breaks development into small, incremental cycles known as sprints. Agile encourages continuous feedback, adaptability, and frequent releases, making it ideal for fast-changing environments like mobile app development or cloud-based SaaS platforms.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developers are responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code to build software applications. QA Engineers focus on ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans, conducting both manual and automated testing, and identifying defects and the Project Manager (PM) oversees the entire development process, ensuring projects stay on schedule, within budget, and meet their objectives. They facilitate communication between stakeholders, developers, and QA teams, manage project risks, and implement methodologies to track progress and ensure successful project completion.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. They integrate features like syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging tools, and build automation, making development faster and more efficient. Examples of popular IDEs include Visual Studio Code, which supports multiple programming languages and extensions, JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, widely used for Java development, and Eclipse, known for its flexibility and plugin support. VCS, on the other hand, plays a crucial role in tracking code changes, enabling collaboration, and preventing data loss. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work, maintaining a history of changes for easy rollback and debugging. A widely used VCS is Git, often paired with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, another example is Apache Subversion (SVN), used for version control in enterprise environments that require a centralized repository.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time management and meeting deadlines, balancing multiple tasks while ensuring high-quality output can be overwhelming.
Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technologies, the tech industry evolves quickly, making it difficult to stay updated.
Security and Data Privacy Concerns, writing secure code and protecting user data is critical but often overlooked.
Strategies to overcome these challenges include: 
Use agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban to break tasks into smaller, manageable parts. 
Engaging in continuous learning through online courses, technical blogs, open-source contributions, and attending conferences or webinars.
Following secure coding practices, conducting regular security audits, and staying informed about emerging cybersecurity threats.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation. This helps catch errors early, making debugging easier and reducing development costs. Example: Testing a function that calculates user discounts in an e-commerce platform.
Integration Testing checks whether multiple modules work together correctly. Since software consists of interconnected components, this phase ensures that they communicate as expected. Integration testing helps detect issues like data mismatches, API failures, or improper function calls between different parts of the system.
System testing evaluates the entire application as a whole, ensuring that it meets the specified requirements. This phase is essential for identifying unexpected behaviour before deployment.
The final step, acceptance testing, determines whether the software meets business requirements and user expectations. This is often performed by end users or clients to validate that the software is ready for release. If the software does not meet their needs, revisions are made before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI models and achieve desired responses. The importance of prompt engineering lies in its ability to enhance AI usability and performance. Well-designed prompts can guide the model to provide clear, specific, and contextually accurate answers, reducing ambiguity and irrelevant responses. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
Tell me about software engineering.

Improved Prompt:
Explain the key principles of software engineering, including maintainability, scalability, and security. Provide real-world examples of how these principles are applied in software development.
The improved prompt is more clear, more specific, and more concise because it narrows the focus, sets clear expectations and includes real-world applications.
